<li><strong>Prototype Postmortem:</strong>
What did you learn from this prototype: developing the game with states, chess algorithm.
What was the easiest or hardest part of making it. Hard part: graphics and computer algorithm.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
Borrowed from the internet and the template. Sources: google.  Code for 'Exit' state copied from the template.
